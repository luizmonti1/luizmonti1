### 🎯 What I Bring to the Table

- 15 years of real-world business experience — I understand how systems need to *work*, not just run  
- Backend development using Python, FastAPI, and Flask, focused on solving operational bottlenecks  
- Seamless automation of business processes using REST APIs, asynchronous tasks, and LLMs  
- Built tools that save time, reduce costs, and empower decision-making across logistics, commerce, and admin ops  
- Deep commitment to **clarity**, **logic**, and finishing what matters — with the same urgency and ownership I had running my own company
