Hello! I'm Luiz Monti, a Python developer specializing in web development, data analysis, and automation. About a year of developing my own Python, web scraping, database management, API integration, and creating automated solutions. Now, I have decided to start with the next step and do some freelancing. Feeling ready for it.
I focused on backend Python development. I have a few functioning data analysis/scraper functioning scripts. Focused on ML and AI and love to bring solutions to the table.
I'm taking a course on ethical hacking, and I'm all set up. Need to start trying. All I needed was to adapt to Kali. Python is covered already.
