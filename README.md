Hi! I'm Luiz, 33YO. 
  About one year ago, I decided to start doing something I like doing for a living. When I started working with GPT, I couldn't go further in about two months because I needed Python skills to create all the crazy bots my adh(focus on H) and mind create every other week. Then, I started with some online courses that needed to be faster. I had GitHub Copilot and Openai to help me develop everything I wanted. It took a lot of patience. Some of the starting scripts I made took about 50 to 60 hours to develop. But that's the beauty. Now I can do them all by myself. I got constantly frustrated with how a perfectly working ML leads manager stopped working, and suddenly, my computer was all f**** up.... (about ten complete wipeouts in 1 year). But now I'm in a place where I can start working with other developers. Because I found my niche in development, and I already know how everything about Python works (but if I don't, I have my AI friends that consume my health, but we always find a solution).
  I'm going to start sharing some of my work. It all scrambled still because when they started working, I started expanding, adapting, and creating multiple uses for them. But I'm organized.
